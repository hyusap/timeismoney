# Time is Money - A Dystopian Social Commentary Platform

**A Black Mirror-style parody exploring the commodification of human time and labor.**

## Project Concept

This platform takes the phrase "time is money" to its extreme, dystopian conclusion:

- **Your day is divided into 15-minute chunks**
- **Anyone can place bids on these time slots** via blockchain auction
- **Highest bidder gains control** for that 15 minutes:
  - Direct you via instructions
  - Watch you through your camera (LiveKit streaming)
  - Make you do whatever they want within that timeframe
- **Built as social commentary/parody** - intentionally dystopian to critique modern labor commodification

**Note:** This is meant as artistic commentary and parody, not an ethical business model. Lean into the dystopian aesthetic.
