# Time is Money ‚è∞üí∞

> *"What if we took 'time is money' literally?"*

A dystopian social commentary platform built as a Black Mirror-style parody exploring the commodification of human time and labor.

## üé≠ The Concept

**Time is Money** takes the phrase to its extreme, logical conclusion:

1. **Your day gets split into 15-minute chunks**
2. **Anyone can bid on your time** using blockchain-based auctions (Sui)
3. **Highest bidder gains control** for that 15 minutes:
   - Watch you through your camera
   - Give you instructions and tasks
   - Direct your actions in real-time
4. **You comply** (for the money, of course)

This is intentionally dystopian as **social commentary and parody** - a critique of how modern capitalism commodifies every aspect of human existence. Lean into the discomfort.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is **artistic commentary and parody**. It's meant to provoke thought about labor commodification, not to be implemented as a real business model. The dystopian nature is intentional.
