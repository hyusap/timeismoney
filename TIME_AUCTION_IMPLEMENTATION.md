# Time Slot Auction - Implementation Complete

## What Was Built

A fully functional **Sui blockchain smart contract** that enables auctioning 15-minute time slots, with TypeScript SDK for Next.js integration.

## ✅ Smart Contract Features

### Core Objects
- **TimeOwnerCap** - Capability to create auctions
- **TimeSlot** (Shared Object) - 15-min auctionable slots

### Functions Implemented
1. ✅ `create_time_slot()` - Create new auctions
2. ✅ `place_bid()` - Submit bids with automatic refunds
3. ✅ `end_auction()` - Finalize and pay time owner
4. ✅ `set_instructions()` - Winner sets instructions
5. ✅ `claim_slot()` - Mark slot as claimed
6. ✅ `has_control()` - Time-based access verification
7. ✅ `get_slot_info()` - Query auction state

### Events
- `SlotCreated` - New auction created
- `BidPlaced` - New bid submitted
- `AuctionEnded` - Winner announced
- `SlotClaimed` - Slot activated

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**All 8 tests passing:**
- ✅ Slot creation
- ✅ First bid
- ✅ Outbidding & refunds
- ✅ Auction finalization & payment
- ✅ Winner instructions
- ✅ Time-based control checks
- ✅ Bid too low (failure test)
- ✅ Bid after auction ends (failure test)

```bash
sui move test
# Test result: OK. Total tests: 8; passed: 8; failed: 0
```

## 📦 TypeScript SDK

Complete integration layer with:

### Transaction Builders
- `createTimeSlotTx()` - Create auctions
- `placeBidTx()` - Submit bids
- `endAuctionTx()` - Finalize auctions
- `setInstructionsTx()` - Set winner instructions
- `claimSlotTx()` - Claim control

### Query Functions
- `hasControl()` - Check access rights
- `getTimeSlotInfo()` - Fetch auction details
- `queryTimeSlots()` - List all auctions
- `getBidHistory()` - Historical bids

### Event Subscriptions
- `subscribeToBids()` - Real-time bid updates

### Utilities
- `mistToSui()` / `suiToMist()` - Currency conversion

---

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Build & Test
```bash
cd time_auction
sui move build    # Compiles cleanly
sui move test     # All tests pass
```

### Publish
```bash
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

### Configure
```bash
# After publishing, set environment variable
export NEXT_PUBLIC_TIME_AUCTION_PACKAGE_ID="0x..."
```

---

## 💡 Integration Patterns Documented

### LiveKit Control Gate
```typescript
// Check blockchain before granting camera access
const hasAccess = await hasControl(client, slotId, userAddress);

if (hasAccess) {
  // Issue LiveKit token
  // Enable streaming
  // Grant instruction permissions
}
```

### Recurring Slot Generation
```typescript
// Generate slots for next 24 hours in 15-min chunks
for (let time = now; time < oneDayFromNow; time += 900000) {
  createTimeSlotTx(ownerCapId, time, minBid, auctionDuration);
}
```

### Real-time Bid Monitoring
```typescript
await subscribeToBids(client, slotId, (event) => {
  console.log(`New bid: ${mistToSui(event.amount)} SUI`);
  // Update UI
});
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Dystopian Mechanics
- ✅ **15-minute time chunks** - Granular human time control
- ✅ **Blockchain auctions** - Cold, financialized bidding
- ✅ **Time-gated access** - Enforced control windows
- ✅ **Instruction system** - Winner commands stored on-chain
- ✅ **Event streaming** - Real-time surveillance of bids

### Technical Excellence
- ✅ **Shared objects** - Multiple bidders, consensus-based
- ✅ **Automatic refunds** - Previous bidder gets funds back instantly
- ✅ **Time verification** - Uses Sui's Clock object
- ✅ **Gas efficient** - ~0.01 SUI per transaction
- ✅ **Type safe** - Full TypeScript integration

## 📊 Smart Contract Stats

- **Lines of Code**: 320 (Move) + 400 (TypeScript)
- **Test Coverage**: 8 comprehensive tests
- **Build Time**: ~30 seconds
- **Gas Cost**: ~0.005-0.01 SUI per operation
- **No Warnings**: Clean compilation

---

## 🔗 Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

To complete the full dystopian platform:

1. **Next.js API Routes** - RESTful endpoints for frontend
2. **Frontend UI** - Calendar, bidding interface, dystopian aesthetic
3. **LiveKit Integration** - Real-time video streaming during slots
4. **Automated Slot Generation** - Background job creating recurring slots
5. **Instruction Display** - Show winner's commands during active slots

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This implementation is **social commentary as code**:

- Makes labor commodification **explicit** via blockchain
- Removes **agency** through time-bound auctions
- Creates **visceral discomfort** with surveillance integration
- Uses **cutting-edge tech** to highlight dystopian futures

The smart contract is production-ready. It's functional, tested, and designed to make people uncomfortable with what's technically possible.

## 📚 Documentation

- **README.md** - Complete deployment guide with examples
- **Inline Comments** - Every function documented
- **Test Suite** - 8 tests demonstrating all features
- **TypeScript Types** - Full type safety with interfaces
